### The place for scientists and engineers that love rocks and computers.

The **Software Underground** is a grass-roots community of digital subsurface professionals. We are academic and applied geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and others.

The [community Slack](https://softwareunderground.org/slack) is the heart of the Software Underground community. It’s completely free to join our group of 3500+ friends — ask questions, help others, or just lurk. Conversation is all digital subsurface, all the time. Everyone is welcome!
